#Android-VideoView

VideoView is used to play video, a great replacement for `android.widget.VideoView VideoView`. 

We define a custom view, as we could not use `android.widget.VideoView` VideoView in ListView. VideoViews inside ScrollViews do not scroll properly. Even if you use the workaround to set the background color, the `MediaController` does not scroll along with the `VideoView`. Also, the scrolling video looks horrendous with the workaround, lots of flickering.
